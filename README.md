# Minecraft Custom Start Screen Project  


## **What’s This About?**  
- It’s a custom Minecraft start screen.  
- It has cool backgrounds.  
- It has animations that probably spin better than your fidget spinner.  
- And yeah, there’s some text here and there to make you feel like royalty.  


## **Features**  
- **Custom Backgrounds:** Fancy layers of awesomeness.  
- **Loading Screen:** Spins and fades because why not?  
- **Welcome Message:** *"Hey there, champ! You made it!"*  
- **Copyright Texts:** Because, you know, legal stuff.
